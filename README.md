# Autodraw

Autodraw is a powerful and intuitive tool that converts any imported image into a detailed sketch. It transforms the image into precise lines, allowing you to sketch it out effortlessly. Designed to work directly with your mouse, it operates in the background, making it undetectable. Sketchful.io and Skribbl.io, Autodraw runs in a small, unobtrusive window, letting you use it while you play games like `Skribbl.io`, `Gartic.io` and `Sketchful.io.` Its features a modern and responsive GUI for your computer. Autocheat programs cannot detect this running because it uses the `pyautogui` library.
